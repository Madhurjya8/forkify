Here is a working live demo: https://forkify-madhurjya.netlify.app/


## About The Project

![forkify](https://github.com/Madhurjya8/forkify/blob/master/forkify.PNG?raw=true)

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Parcel to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and save to a favorites list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease servings as per their need and can view detailed directions.





## Built With

This app is built with pure vanilla Javascript, using the Model View Controller Architecture.
For all the recipe data, it uses the [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2)

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Features :rocket:

1. The Forkify Recipe App allows users to search for recipes.
2. Users can view the recipe along with the cook time and also increase or decrease the amount of servings they need.
3. Bookmarked recipes are stored in local storage so no database was required for this application.
4. Users can also upload their own recipes for future reference. The own recipes are stored in local storage.
